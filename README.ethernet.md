---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bits   Description                                                     Type   Default
------ --------------------------------------------------------------- ------ ---------
15     **MDIO Buffer Type** When set to a 0, the MDIO output is        R/W    0b
       open-drain. When set to a 1, the MDIO output is push-pull

14     **INT Buffer Type** When set to a 0, the INT_N output is        R/W    0b
       open-drain. When set to a 1, the INT_N output is push-pull.
       Note: If the buffer type is set to open-drain, INT_N is always
       active low.

13:8   **LED Buffer Type** When set to a 0, the LED pins are           R/W    000000b
       open-drain or open-source. When set to a 1, the LED pins are
       push-pull Bit 8 is for LED1, bit 9 for LED2, etc.

7      **PME Polarity** When set to a 0, the PME_N pin is active low.  R/W    0b
       When set to a 1, the PME_N pin is active high

6      **RESERVED**                                                    R/W    \-

5:0    **LED Polarity** When set to a 0, the LED pins are active low.  R/W    Note 1
       When set to a 1, the LED pins are active high Bit 0 is for      NASR
       LED1, bit 1 is for LED2 etc
